Homework 4

1. How does an interpreted programming language differ from a compiled language?
Interpreted languages execute code line by line, while compiled languages are converted into machine code before running. This affects performance and debugging

2. Contrast dynamically typed programming languages with statically typed ones. And
contrast strongly typed programming languages with weakly typed ones.
Dynamically typed languages determine variable types at runtime, allowing flexibility but increasing type-related errors. Statically typed languages enforce types at compile time. Strongly typed-languages strictly enforce type rules, while weakly typed languages allow more implicit type conversions.


3. What is the difference between var, let, and const when declaring variables in JS?
Var is function-scoped, Let is block-scoped and allows reassignment, Const is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned. Let and const provide better scope control.

4. What are anonymous functions? Higher order functions? Callback functions? First class
functions?

Anonymous functions have no name and are often used temporarily.Higher-order functions take or return other functions.Callback functions are passed as arguments and executed later.First-class functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned.

5. Define objects in JavaScript.
Objects store key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be any data type. They help organize and manage data in JavaScript



6. Loop through the cats array variable found here:
https://github.com/cisc3300/SP25-lecture-code/blob/main/2-13-lecture/cats.js
a. if the cats adoption status is available add that cat’s name to a result array
b. create a new sentence about your newly adopted cats from your result array via
the join array function.
7. Create a variable that sets a value via a ternary operator. Use Math.random() * 10, which
will output a random number from 1 to 10, to set the variable’s value as a string of
“greater than five!” if the output from Math.random() * 10 is greater than 5, and “less than
five!” if the output is less than 5.
8. Loop through the values of the cat object variable found here:
https://github.com/cisc3300/SP25-lecture-code/blob/main/2-13-lecture/cats.js. Console.log
the value of each property in the loop.
9. Write two if statements, pick the correct comparison operator to have the first if
statement equate an integer of 1 and a string of ‘1’ as true. And pick the correct
comparison operator to have the second equate an integer of 1 and a string of ‘1’ as
false.
10. Using the map function create a new array via the cats array used in question 6. Pass
the map function a callback function that accepts each element of the array as a
parameter. Return the value of the name property of each object in the cats array
concatenated with the string “ is cute!”. The output should be an array of “Charlie is
cute!”, “Lily is cute!”, etc.
Include questions 6-10 in a single JavaScript file or HTML file via a script tag.
