1. _Higher-order functions_ are functions that return a function or take other functions as arguments.
2. _functional_ programming is a declarative programming paradigm style where one
applies pure functions in sequence to solve complex problems
3. we can access object properties in JS with _dot notation _ or _bracket notation _
4. Logical operators are processed left to right. They _short-circuit _ as soon as they have a
result
5. _declarative programs_ write code that describes what you want, but not necessarily how to get it.
6. Create a function to return true if a given string params includes the word “pinecone”,
you can use the .includes builtin string function. Create an array that contains few
sentences at different indexes and include pinecone in at least one of them. Use the filter
function to create a new array using the function you created.
